## C++

<Warning>This client is under development</Warning>

The C++ client offers a way to interact with the API of Jutge.org using the C++ programming language.

### Download

The C++ client is currently distributed as a single C++ file you must include:

<DownloadClientButton 
    href="/clients/download/cpp" 
    title="Download C++ client" />

In order to use it you need to download some header only libraries: [yhirose/cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib), and [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).

Compilation, then, would go like this:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -lssl -lcrypto -o program *.cc 
```
