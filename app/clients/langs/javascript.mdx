## JavaScript

<Warning>This client is under development</Warning>

The JavaScript client offers a simple way to interact with the API of Jutge.org using the JavaScript programming language.

The JavaScript client is very easy to use. It is asynchronous and non blocking, making use of the modern async/await syntax. The JavaScript client is specially designed to be used in a browser. For apps and servers, please consider using [the TypeScript client](/clients/typescript).

### Download

The JavaScript client is currently distributed as a single JavaScript file:

<DownloadClientButton 
    href="/clients/download/javascript"
    title="Download Javascript client" />

This client has no dependencies.
