import DownloadClientButton from '@/components/download-client-button.tsx'

## Python

The Python client offers a simple way to interact with the API of [Jutge.org](https://jutge.org) using the Python programming language.

The Python client is very easy to use. It is synchronous and blocking, so that you can write command line applications that are easy to write,understand and debug.

Thanks to the use of type hints and docstrings, the code you write is type safe and you get code completion and help everywhere in any modern IDE. Less time debugging and less time reading docs.

### Download

The Python client is currently distributed as a single Python file you can import:

<DownloadClientButton 
    href="/clients/download/python" 
    title="Download Python client" />

In order to use it, you have to install some dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install requests requests-toolbelt pyyaml rich pydantic
```

 If `pip` complains, either add the `--break-system-packages` flag or use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
