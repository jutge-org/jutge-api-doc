# PHP Client

The PHP client offers a crude way to interact with the API of [Jutge.org](https://jutge.org) using the PHP programming language. We only develop it to support the transition of the old PHP code to the new API.

## Download

The PHP client is currently distributed as a single PHP file you can import:

<DownloadClientButton 
    href="/api/clients/php" filename="jutge_api_client.php" />

This client has no dependencies (except for a deep tolerance of PHP ðŸ˜‰).
