# Javascript client

The JavaScript client offers a simple way to interact with the API of [Jutge.org](https://jutge.org) using the JavaScript programming language.

The JavaScript client is very easy to use. It is asynchronous and non blocking, making use of the modern async/await syntax. The JavaScript client is specially designed to be used in a browser. For apps and servers, please consider using [the TypeScript client](/clients/typescript)

## Download

The JavaScript client is currently distributed as a single JavaScript file:

<DownloadClientButton 
    href="/api/clients/javascript" filename="jutge_api_client.js" />

This client has no dependencies.
