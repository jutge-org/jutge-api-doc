# TypeScript client

The TypeScript client offers a simple way to interact with the API of Jutge.org using the TypeScript programming language.

The TypeScript client is very easy to use. It is asynchronous and non blocking, making use of the modern async/await syntax. This allows you to write code that can run in any dynamic environment, like an app or a server.

Thanks to the use of types, the code you write is type safe and you get
code completion and help everywhere in any modern IDE. Less time
debugging and less time reading docs.

In order to use the TypeScript client in an easy and efficient way, we
recommend you to use [Bun](https://bun.sh/).
