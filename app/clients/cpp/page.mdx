<Warning>This client is under development</Warning>

# C++ client

The C++ client offers a way to interact with the API of Jutge.org using the C++ programming language.

## Download

The C++ client is currently distributed as a single C++ file you must include:

<DownloadClientButton 
    href="/api/clients/cpp" filename="jutge_api_client.cpp" />

In order to use it you need to download some header only libraries: [yhirose/cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib), and [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).

Compilation, then, would go like this:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 program.cpp -l ssl -l crypto
```
