# Command Line Interface (CLI)

To use the API, there is also a command-line interface (CLI) available. The CLI is written in Typescript and can be installed easily using [npm](https://npmjs.com) or [Bun](https://bun.sh):

```bash
npm install -g @jutge.org/cli
```

or

```bash
bun add -g @jutge.org/cli
```

This will install a binary called **`jutge`** which is the entrypoint for the CLI. 

To update it, just install it again.

## Usage

The CLI itself can be used to get the same documentation [available on this site](/documentation), since it uses the endpoint information (the "directory") and maps endpoints and endpoint groups to commands or subcommands.

For example, just invoking `jutge` produces:

```text
$ jutge
Usage: jutge [options] [command]

Jutge.org CLI

Options:
  -h, --help        display help for command

Commands:
  login [options]   Login to Jutge.org
  logout [options]  Logout from Jutge.org
  auth              Module to provide authentication functions.
  misc              Module with miscellaneous endpoints
  tables            Module with quite static tables
  problems          Module with endpoints related to problems.
  student           These operations are available to all users, provided they are authenticated.
  instructor        This module is meant to be used by instructors
  admin             Module with administration endpoints. Not meant for regular users. It still lacks lots of endpoints
  testing           Module with testing endpoints. Not meant for regular users.
  accounts          Manage accounts in this CLI
  version           Show the Jutge.org/cli version
  help [command]    display help for command
```

By invoking "`jutge student`" you receive help about the `student` section of the API:

```text
Ôê≤  jutge student
Usage: jutge student [options] [command]

These operations are available to all users, provided they are authenticated.

Options:
  -h, --help      display help for command

Commands:
  keys            This module exposes all valid keys for problems, courses and lists that a user can access.
  profile         This module exposes the user profile.
  dashboard       <undocumented>
  submissions     <undocumented>
  courses         <undocumented>
  lists           <undocumented>
  statuses        <undocumented>
  awards          This module is not yet finished.
  help [command]  display help for command
```

Also, the mapping is straightforward, and therefore using the CLI is a good way to get to know the API and its endpoints.

So, before invoking any of the endpoints, you can explore what is available and get help about each endpoint (if available!). Also, appending `--help` to any invocation will give you help, even if you already provided arguments or options, so it is a good way to make sure you are using the CLI correctly.

## Options and Parameters

In general, when an endpoint of the API receives only one piece of data, it will be an argument. For instance, the argument in this call is the award's ID:

```bash
$ jutge student awards get A0012284589
```

For endpoints that require specifying several fields, long options (with two dashes) are typically used:

```bash
jutge instructor queries getCourseProblemSubmissions \
    --course_nm "PRO3_2028" \
    --problem_nm "P86886_ca" 
```

Whenever there are input files to an API call, they are always arguments. For instance, changing your avatar is:

```bash
$ jutge student profile updateAvatar selfie_at_VLA.png
```

The argument just indicates a path to a file which will be read and sent to the API.

## Authentication

The CLI can send direct calls to the API to retrieve a token (with `jutge auth login`), but a more user-friendly way is to use the `login`, `logout` and `accounts` subcommands (whih are not to be confused with `auth login` and `auth logout`).

### Logging in

```bash
jutge login
```

This will prompt for your email and password. A second execution in the same computer will only prompt for the password since the email will be internally associated with de "default account". Changing that is easy:

```bash
jutge login -e pedro.botero@infer.no
```

### Logging out 

```bash
jutge logout
```

This will log you out (and discard the token).

### Accounts

Since many professors use more than one account, the CLI allows you to register and manage several accounts. This is done with the `accounts` subcommand:

```text
$ jutge accounts list
* default - pedro.botero@infer.no (logged in until 03/14/1592, 05:04:03)
```

The `*` indicates the active account. Since at the beginning there is only one account (name "default"), it is the active one. You can add more accounts with:

```text
$ jutge accounts add -e pro3@cs.upc.edu pro3
Account 'pro3' added.
```

This will add the "pro3" account with its email. Listing accounts should show:

```text
$ jutge accounts list
* default - pedro.botero@infer.no (logged in until 03/14/1592, 05:04:03)
  pro3 - pro3@cs.upc.edu
```

If you plan to use the "pro3" account for a while, you can activate it with:

```text
$ jutge accounts use pro3
```

You can also use the "pro3" account in just one endpoint call (and therefore keep the currently active account), by using the `-a` option, which is available in all endpoints:

```text
$ jutge login -a pro3
$ jutge student profile -a pro3
```

Once you are done with the "pro3" account, you can remove it:

```text
$ jutge accounts remove pro3
Account 'pro3' removed.
```

The "default" account is always available and cannot be removed.
